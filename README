This is an example application demonstrating Authlogic running on Rails 3.

It also includes RSpec tests for the Authlogic controller.

To run the app:
bundle install
rake db:migrate
rails s
open http://localhost:3000

The root directory redirects to the login page.

To run the tests:
bundle install
rake db:migrate
rake db:test:prepare
rake

You can also run autotest for continual testing.

The version of Authlogic used here is a fork that is at:
git://github.com/odorcicd/authlogic.git branch 'rails3'

I am using this because I got a "to_key" error with the official repo.
